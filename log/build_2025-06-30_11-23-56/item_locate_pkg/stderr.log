[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgeomotry_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "geomotry_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "geomotry_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    geomotry_msgsConfig.cmake
    geomotry_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "geomotry_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "geomotry_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "geomotry_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
